            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                There is a need for easy-to-install, easy-to-use, and easy-to-support educational materials that can be distributed to different individuals and communities lacking access to proper cyber resources and the support of dedicated IT staff. Addressing this need, we introduce E-Cubes, a customizable, extensible, and convenient educational framework, which is deployed as open-access, plug-and-play, and hands-on learning modules.
            </p>

                E-Cubes is available via the Open Source via CC BY (Creative Commons) licensing option as a series of self-contained modules featuring four layers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Container layer:</strong> Provides enhanced convenience for installing E-Cubes in user-specific hardware and software platforms leveraging OS-level virtualization.</li>
                <li><strong>The Tools layer:</strong> Provides the necessary back-end software platforms supporting the educational tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>The Payload layer:</strong> Contains the educational materials for the learning experience, such as course assignments and lab sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>The Support layer:</strong> Contains additional materials like tutorials, videos, and documentation websites to assist students.</li>
